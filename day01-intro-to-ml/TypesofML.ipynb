        "### Supervised Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition:** Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example has an associated \"correct\" output or label. The algorithm learns to map input features to the corresponding output labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:** The training process involves feeding the algorithm input data along with the desired output. The algorithm then learns a function that can predict the output for new, unseen input data. This learning is \"supervised\" because the algorithm's predictions are compared to the actual labels, and the model is adjusted based on the errors.\n",

        "**How it works:** Unlike supervised learning, there is no \"correct\" answer provided during training. The algorithm explores the data on its own to discover insights. This can involve grouping similar data points together or reducing the dimensionality of the data.\n",
